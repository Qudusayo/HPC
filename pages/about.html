                Because struggling sucks! I know, I was there. I spent the long days and nights working - missing time
                with my family and friends - just to get by. It was not fun... It was not fulfilling.
                <br><br>
                Through years of this, I was able to break free, and find the habits and characteristics that produce
                success. I was able to gain the freedom and fulfillment in my business, the industry, and with my

                businesses, their lives, their families, and their communities.
